#openquake code is added here for convenience should be replaced in production
#by an actual openquake installation on server

# get the global vs30 grid:
unzip updated_lima_valparaiso_global_vs30_grd.zip
mv updated_lima_valparaiso_global_vs30.grd global_vs30.grd

#add to PYTHONPATH (had trouble using env.sh from openquake --> gmt was using system gdal but openquake sqlite3 and complained)
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/mhaas/openquake/lib/python3.5/site-packages/

#requires python libs:
mock
psutil

#currently requires gmt --> will be removed

#service can be run with the Test/test.xml (quakeml) event like:
python3 service.py Test/test.xml

# You can look up some documentation about the used grid file for share wave velocity
# on the usgs website
